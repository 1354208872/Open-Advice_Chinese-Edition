\section*{前言}

当Lydia邀请我加入她的题为“那些我希望当时就知道的事”的新书项目时，我的思绪一片空白。
那些我希望当时就知道的却不知道的事？我想不起来有这样的事。

我不是在说我不需要学习任何事，相反，我必需学习很多并且在过程中犯下了数不清的错误。
但是那其中有我期望避免的情况或错误吗？我认为没有。

我们所有人都有这样的烦人的趋向，就是在意那些我们可以做得更好和我们所不知的事，
并且认为这些是弱点。但当弱点成为我们的强项时又会如何？

以下是我个人的关于无知、天真和错觉的故事，也是我自己也不知道我有多么快乐的故事。

\section*{名字}

当时我并不知道那个在我工作第一天遭遇的那位同事是谁。
他进入了房间，自我介绍后开始问我各种难题，这给了一种那些我将要做的事情都是没有意义的印象。
他显然很清楚我将要在KDE社区从事的工作以及我之前打交道的人。
然而我们看起来有不同的立场。在一些观点上，我逐渐对他的挑衅感到厌烦并且失去耐心。
我告诉他和人打交道这类事情并不总是像工程师们认为的那样容易。

我们大约进行了一个小时的讨论，直到他离开后，我才谷歌了一下他的名字：Matthias Ettrich。
我阅读了他的事迹，从而明白他为何会问那些问题。如果我早点知道他是KDE项目的建立者之一，
那么我很可能会以另一种方式和他争论————当然这只是假设。

在过去一年里，我必须查找相当数量的名字，不过我很高兴每次都是在初次联系\textit{后}再去查找。

这也许是我最重要的观点。当我第一次见到那些FOSS的人时，我几乎从未听说过他们的名字。
我不知道他们的背景，他们的长处，或者是他们的失败事迹。我以同样的方式对待每一个人：平等。

因为无知（或者像某些人所说的，天真），在开始我的FOSS旅程后，对于那些遇见的人，我并没有感到低人一等。
我知道我需要学习很多东西，但我从不觉得，作为一个人而言，我处于一个比他人低等的位置。

\section*{“高姿态的项目”}

I had not religiously followed dot.kde.org nor PlanetKDE, let alone all those
countless other FOSS related publications before I started lurking on KDE
mailing-lists. I perceived those channels first and foremost as means of
communication to a very select audience, mainly users of and contributors to the
project itself. 
我并没有认真地去追随dot.kde.org或者是PlanetKDE，当我在KDE的邮件列表潜水前，不会去关注那些数不清的FOSS相关的发表内容。
我认为那些渠道首先并且重点都是针对特定读者的，主要是这个项目的用户和贡献者。

For quite some time, it did not even cross my mind that the articles I published
on The Dot might be picked up by journalists. I put an effort into writing them
because I wanted to do a good job rather than because I was afraid of making a
fool out of myself in the world's face. The press list was maintained by other
people and what I wrote did not appear that important to me either. I wanted to
reach certain people, and the official channels and my own blog seemed like the
most efficient way of doing it.
有相当一段时间，我从未想过那些我发表在Dot上的文章会被记者采纳。
我花精力来些文章是因为我想做好自己的工作而不是害怕他人觉得我是个傻瓜。
出版文章的选择是其他人负责的，而且我写的东西对我自己来说也并不重要。
我曾经想和某些人交流，而官方的渠道和我的个人博客看来是最有效的方式。

Being quoted on ReadWriteWeb after announcing on my blog that I would start a
new job almost came as a shock to me. It is not that I did not know that people
read what I write -- I certainly hope they do! -- I simply did not expect it to
be that much of a topic. It wasn't even summer break.
当我在自己博客上宣布我要开始一项新工作后，居然会在ReadWriteWeb上被引用，这使我大吃一惊。
并不是因为我不知道他们读了我写的文章——我当然希望他们有读过，我只是不想这事变得太话题而已。
这连夏日休假都算不上。

Good thing nobody told me; I would not have been able to publish a single line.
没人告诉我好事，我宁愿没发表过一行字。

\section*{局外人}

Some time ago when I attended my first conference I did so with the firm belief
that I was different from the other attendees. I saw myself as an outsider
because I did not have much in common with anybody else apart from a fuzzy
interest in technology: I had been freelancing for some years already after
graduating from university, I had no relevant education in the field, and I was
mother of a 10 year-old child. On paper at least, it could not get much
different from the usual suspects one meets inside FOSS projects.

In 2008 I attended a KOffice sprint as part of the KDE marketing and promotion
team to prepare the 2.0 release. The initial idea was to sketch out a series of
promotional activities supporting the release to grow both developer and user
base, for which there were three of us running a parallel track to the developer
discussion.

We tried to understand how we could position KOffice and adapt communication to
the intended audience. Pretty soon in the process, we discovered that we had to
take a step back: at that point, the immaturity of the suite made it impossible
to position it as an option for unsuspecting users. We had to stick with
developers and early adopters. It was a tough sell to some of the developers but
as outsiders we had the chance to look at the software without thinking of all
the blood, sweat and tears that went into the code.

For a lot of projects, no matter of which kind they are, the core contributors
have a hard time taking an objective look at the state of affairs. We tend to
not see the great accomplishments while we are so focused on the issues in
detail, or the other way around. Sometimes we miss a good opportunity because we
\textit{think} it has nothing to do with what we are doing -- or that no-one
would want this in the first place.

In all these cases, people outside the project have the potential to inject some
different viewpoints into the discussion, particularly when it comes to
prioritization. It is even more helpful if they are not developers themselves:
they will ask different questions, will not feel pressured into knowing and
understanding all technical details, and they can help decisions and
communication on a higher level.

\section*{Conclusion}

Ignorance is bliss. It is not only true for the individuals who benefits from
the fearlessness that results from a lack of knowledge but also for the projects
these individuals join. They bring different views and experiences.

And now, go and find yourself a project that interests you, regardless of what
you think you know.
