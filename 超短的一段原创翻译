SCALE was started 9 years ago by members of three local Linux Users Group,growing outof a small regional event organized by one of these LUGs.
SCALE产生于一个小规模的区域性项目，是于9年前开始正式由三个区域性的LINUX用户构成的团队里的成员运作的，而正是这三个团队之一组织了那个最开始的“小项目”。


The first time around was definitely a learning experience. Many lessons were learned,there was quite a bit of running around and the event seemed to fly by very quickly. 
刚开始的时候很多努力都是交了 学费一样，但是明显地，很多经验总结之后，仍然有很多时间和汗水白费了，这个项目看起来更加不可完成。


Because none of us had planned an event where we had to be concerned about the load on electrical circuits or power usage, we had not considered it and because of that we ended up tripping the electrical breakers for the venue several times throughout the event.
因为我们当中没有一个人有在我们必须高度关注的关于回流电路和用电负荷这方面的策划经验，所以我们没有考虑到这方面，从而导致我们以数次在断路器上出错的结果结束进程。
